# Friend Space
Welcome to Friend Space! This is an online platform that allows CodeWorks students to stay connected as they continue their journey as software developers. This is my first big application created using Vue.js.

- Create and update their profile information
- Search for other CodeWorks students using various search criteria
- Send friend requests and accept or reject requests from other users
- View a list of their friends and navigate to their profiles
- Post messages and comments on a public wall for all users to see

### Technology used
_Friend Space was built using the following technologies:_

### About the project
Friend Space was created while I at Boise Code Works as a checkpoint project to demonstrate my knowledge of VueJS, working with APIs, and identity management using Auth0.
